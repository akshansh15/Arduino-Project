5-Player Quiz Buzzer System using Arduino

This is a manual quiz buzzer system built using an Arduino Uno, designed to support 5 players for fast and fair quiz competitions. Each player has a dedicated button, and the system locks in the first response, displaying the winner using LEDs while disabling the rest until reset.

Unlike online buzzer systems, this setup runs completely offline with no lag, ping issues, or connectivity troubles, making it perfect for classrooms, colleges, and live quiz events. It ensures instant response detection and smooth quiz conduction without relying on the internet.
This project showcases practical application of Arduino programming, digital input handling, and real-time response systems.
